## Overview

Endless Math Runner is an engaging and educational endless runner game built in Unity 3D. The game challenges players' arithmetic skills in a fast-paced environment, combining the thrill of endless running with the logic of mathematical operations. Players must choose the correct operator to satisfy randomly generated equations, allowing them to continue their run. A wrong choice ends the game.

## Features

- **Endless Gameplay**: The game continues indefinitely as long as the player selects the correct operator for each equation.
- **Dynamic Equations**: Randomly generated numbers and equations keep the game challenging and engaging.
- **Four Operators**: Players can choose from addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
